This is a basic sanity test for the shadow-utils package. It is implemented
in python on top of the unittesting.py module.

Its purpose is to ensure that the binaries in the shadow-utils package behave
as expected and its switches/options work correctly.

For the most part, every binary in the shadow-utils package is represented by
a single class named Test<BinaryName>, i.e. TestUsermod etc. There are some 
exceptions, like TestUseraddWeirdNameTest though.
